Title: Coupling of Geophysical Models.

Abstract: For essentially historical reasons, the development
of geophysical models has been done in separate independent
directions: atmosphere, circulation, waves and others.
As it happen, the boundary between such domain is especially
important for correct geophysical modelling. We will explain
how such coupling can be effectively achieved.

This will cover the technical part of it, i.e. the construction
of coupling libraries, how they are interfaced and how they
communicate. We will explain our Parallel Geophysical Model
Coupling Library (PGMCL) that achieves that. We will also cover
the parallelization aspects of such coupled models. 

We will first consider the coupling of circulation and wave
models via the coupling Ardhuin and the simplified Bennis
formulation of wave coupling. We will show the effect of coupling
on the circulation models and on the wave models. We will also
consider the numerical aspects of the coupling.

Finally, we will consider the effect of coupling of waves and
atmosphere models. Here the all important aspect is the modelling
of the Chanock coefficient which is the key to the computation
of the surface stress which is a major unknown in geophysical
modeling.
