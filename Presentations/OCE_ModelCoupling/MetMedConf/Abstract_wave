Abstract: The accurate modelling of sea surface gravity waves is essential for accurate
oceanic forecasting with the wave height being a major concern for navigation and coastal
activities. It is also very important for oceanic modelling, with the wave input being
key to the accurate modelling of oceanic surface stress, sediment resuspension, and also
to oceanic current modelling.

In DHMZ, we have implemented the Wind Wave Model III as an operational model. The wind
forcing used is based on the numerical weather prediction model ALADIN/HR. The model is 
configured to dynamically adopt near-surface wind to 2km grid spacing over the 3-day
forecast range. The boundary condition at the Ottranto strait is obtained from the WAM
model forecasts computed at ECMWF. The model setup uses an implicit scheme on an
unstructured grid to make the forecasts.

The forecasts are validated with Altimeter satellite estimates and wave radar measurements.

Keywords: wave model, forecast, altimeter, wave radar
