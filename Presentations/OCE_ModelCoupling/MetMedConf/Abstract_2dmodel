Title: Storm surge modelling
Authors: Mathieu Dutour Sikiric, Aron Roland, Mario Ricchiuto, Maja Bubalo, Mirko Orlic
Abstract: The shallow water equations are a fundamental partial differential
equation system that allow to model the free surface and barotropic momentum.
It is a fundamental component of 2D models which are used in storm surge modelling
but also of 3D baroclinic models, where it serves as an essential component when
using the operator splitting method.

Here we implemented an advanced explicit scheme on unstructured mesh that is
second order, conservative and preserves positivity of the free surface.
The model is implemented in a parallel way which makes it suitable for application
in Oceanography but also in rainfall modelling.

We applied the model on a variety of test cases that reflect how the model can be
used.

Keywords: shallow water equations, circulation, storm surge
