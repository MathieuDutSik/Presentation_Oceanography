Title: Coupling of geophysical models
Authors: Mathieu Dutour Sikiric, Aron Roland, Luigi Cavaleri, Luciana Bertotti, Lucio Torrisi
Abstract: Surface wave models are typically forced with wind obtained from an atmospheric
model. The source term functions used in wave models yield as a byproduct the Charnock
coefficient. This coefficient is key to the parameterization of the roughness of the sea.
Thus in order to get better wind and wave forecasts one needs to couple wind and wave models.

Similarly, the currents acts on waves by changing how they see the wind. The Stokes
drift computed from the wave spectra enters into the primitive equations of circulation in
the ocean. Also wave statistics are used in several parameterizations of ocean models.
Thus it is quite natural to have the wave model coupled with the circulation model.

We have developped an integrated system containing the Wave model WWM or WAM, circulation
model ROMS and Atmospheric model COSMO. We designed the Parallel General Model Coupling
Library (PGMCL) for efficient interfacing of the models. When applied to the Mediterranean
Sea the coupling yield improved results. For currents, result are less clear of the effect
of the coupling.

Keywords: Wave model, circulation model, atmospheric model, coupling
