  \frametitle{Stochastic wave modelling}

\begin{itemize}
\item Oceanic models are using grids (structured or unstructured) of size $1km\leq d\leq 10km$ to simulate the ocean
\item But oceanic waves have a typical wavelength $2m$ $\leq$ $L$ $\leq$ $100m$. So, we cannot resolve waves in the ocean.
\item But if one uses phase averaged models and uses stochastic assumptions
then it is possible to model waves by a spectral wave action density
$N({\bf x},{\bf k})$
\item This density satisfies a Wave Action Equation (\textcolor{red}{WAE}) which represents advection, refraction, frequency shifting and source terms:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial N}{\partial t} + \nabla_x(({\bf c}_g+{\bf u}_A)N) + \nabla_k(\dot{k} N) 
 + \nabla_{\theta}(\dot{\theta} N) = S_{tot}
\end{equation*}
with
\begin{equation*}
S_{tot} = S_{in} + S_{nl3} + S_{nl4} + S_{bot} + S_{ds} + S_{break} + S_{bf}
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
}




%\frame{
%  \frametitle{Doppler shift}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Suppose that we have a uniform current ${\bf u}$ then the dispersion relation is changed to
%\begin{equation*}
%\sigma^2 = g k  \tanh( kh) \mbox{~and~} \omega = \sigma + {\bf k}\cdot {\bf u}
%\end{equation*}
%with $\sigma$ the intrinsic frequency and $\omega$ the absolute frequency.
%\item In the case of a sheared current, the Doppler shift relation changes to
%\begin{equation*}
%\omega = \sigma + {\bf k}\cdot\int_{z=-h}^{z=\xi} {\bf u} \frac{2k\cosh(2k(z+h))}{\sinh(2kD)} dz
%\end{equation*}
%\item The advection velocity ${\bf u}_A$ is usually approximated by the surface current velocity. There is unfortunately no Wave Action Equation in the case of sheared currents.
%\end{itemize}
%}


\frame{
  \frametitle{Wave coupling}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wave models use surface currents for the advection of wave energy and
the free surface enters into the dispersion relation.
\item On the other hand oceanic model can use wave information to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the Stokes drift (current induced by waves, a nonlinear effect).
\item Compute the wave radiation pressure term in the primitive equation.
\item Improve the computation of the surface stress, turbulence.
\item Be used in sediment transport models.
\end{itemize}
\item Thus it makes sense to have oceanic and wave models coupled both ways. We chose to work with the {\tt ROMS} model (a finite difference model) and the {\tt WWM} model (a finite element model by Aron Roland).
\end{itemize}

\frame{
  \frametitle{The WWM model}
The Wind Wave Model is a third generation wave model authored by Aron Roland and which shares many
common features with WaveWatch III.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Wind Wave Model (WWM) is a unstructured grid spectral wave model.
\item It incorporates most existing source term formulation for wind input and dissipation (Cycle III,
Cycle IV, Ardhuin, Makin, ...)
\item It has been coupled to SELFE, SHYFEM, TIMOR and ROMS.
\item It uses Residual Distribution schemes for the horizontal advection.
\item It integrates the WAE by using the Operator Splitting Method in explicit or implicit mode.
\item It has NETCDF output/input/hotfile.
\item Parallelization is done by ParMETIS.
\end{itemize}
}





\frame{
  \frametitle{Stokes drift}
\begin{itemize}
\item For a complete description, the vertical Stokes drift is needed. It is obtained from the equation
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial u_s}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_s}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial w_s}{\partial z} = 0
\end{equation*}
and so we can get $w_s$ by vertical integration from the bottom at $z=-h$ to $z=\xi$.
\item For a phase averaged wave model we can compute the horizontal Stokes drift as an integral over the spectrum ($E({\bf k}) = \sigma N({\bf k})$):
\begin{equation*}
(u,v)_{s} = \int_{\bf k} \frac{E({\bf k}) }{2\sinh^2(k(h+\xi))}\sigma {\bf k}\cosh(2k(z+h)) d{\bf k}.
\end{equation*}
Note that the formula is actually an approximation assuming that the current shear is small. See Ardhuin (2008) for higher order formulas.
\end{itemize}
}




\frame{
  \frametitle{Generalized Lagrangian mean}
\begin{itemize}
\item The idea is to decompose the current as ${\bf u}_{tot} = {\bf u} + {\bf u}_{wave} + {\bf u}_{turb}$ with ${\bf u}$ the steady motion, ${\bf u}_{wave}$ the wave motion and ${\bf u}_{turb}$ the microscopic turbulent motion.
\item Under the assumption that ${\bf u}_{turb}$ is uncorrelated to other motion, we have to investigate the relation between ${\bf u}_{wave}$ and ${\bf u}$ (called \textcolor{red}{Quasi-Eulerian}).
\item We can thus introduce a new particular derivative operator
\begin{equation*}
\frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial }{\partial t} + 
(u+u_{S}) \frac{\partial }{\partial x} +
(v+v_{S}) \frac{\partial }{\partial y} +
(w+w_{S}) \frac{\partial }{\partial z}
\end{equation*}
and the equation for tracers $T$ (i.e. salinity, temperature, turbulent kinetic energy, etc.) is then
\begin{equation*}
\frac{D T}{Dt} = S_{source/sink}(T) + S_{diffusion}(T)
\end{equation*}
%with $C(T)$ the source and sink term and $D(T)$ the diffusion term.

\end{itemize}
}





\frame{
  \frametitle{Equations of the Bennis/Ardhuin 2011 formulation I}

\begin{itemize}
\item For the conservation of momentum we have the equation
\begin{equation*}
\frac{D {\bf u}}{D t} = {\bf F}_{pres} + {\bf F}_{turb} + {\bf F}_{cor} + {\bf F}_{wave} + {\bf F}_{bottom} + {\bf F}_{surf}
\end{equation*}
where ${\bf F}_{pres}$ and ${\bf F}_{turb}$ are the pressure and turbulence terms respectively, while ${\bf F}_{cor}=f_{cor} (v + v_s, -u-u_s)$ is the Coriolis term with $f_{cor}$ the Coriolis factor.
\item The wave pressure term is a 
\begin{equation*}
{\bf F}_{wave} = u_s {\bf \nabla} u + v_s {\bf \nabla} v - {\bf \nabla} J
%\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
%F_{wave, x} &=& \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} v_s + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u_s - \frac{\partial J}{\partial x},\\
%F_{wave, y} &=& \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} v_s + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} u_s - \frac{\partial J}{\partial x}.
%\end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}
with $J$ the 2D wave pressure term given by
\begin{equation*}
J = \int_{\bf k} g\frac{k E({\bf k})}{\sinh(2k (h+\xi))} d{\bf k}
\end{equation*}

\end{itemize}
}





\frame{
  \frametitle{Equations of the Bennis/Ardhuin 2011 formulation II}
\begin{itemize}
\item The equation for the free surface is changed to
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\xi}{dt} + (u + u_s) \frac{d\xi}{dx} + (v+v_s)\frac{d\xi}{dy} = w + w_s
\end{equation*}
\item Boundary conditions are changed from $u=0$ to $u=-u_s$ and similarly for other kind of boundary conditions.
\item The Stokes drift must also be added to the computation of floats trajectories.
\item (Ardhuin, 2008) actually proposed a more complex system of equations with higher order terms.
\item (Mellor, 2003) proposed some expression for the baroclinic stress but some incoherent results were obtained with it.
\item (Longuet-Higgins, 1953) derived an expression for the barotropic stress induced by waves.


%\item (Ardhuin, 2007) proposed a new set of equations with the basic prototype for the tracer equation:
%\begin{equation*}
%\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + 
%(u+u_{S}) \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} +
%(v+v_{S}) \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} +
%(w+w_{S}) \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} = S_T
%\end{equation*}
%with $(u,v,w)_S$ being the Stokes drift and $S_T$ the source of the tracer.
%\item The boundary condition for momentum changes from $u=0$ to $u=-u_S$.
\end{itemize}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Surface stress}
\begin{itemize}
\item Surface stress is a key unknown in many oceanographic simulations.
\item Many formulas depending on the wind ${\bf u}_{10m}$ have been proposed and the Charnock parameter was introduced
\begin{equation*}
\alpha = z_{0,air} \frac{g}{u_{*}^2}
\end{equation*}
with $z_0$ the roughness length and $u_{*}$ the friction velocity. But the variability remains very large.
\item Janssen (1989) proposed to decompose the stress into
\begin{equation*}
\tau = \tau_{viscous}  + \tau_{wave} + \tau_{high.\,freq.}
\end{equation*}
\item The term $\tau_{viscous}$ is negligible. 
\item Janssen (1989) proposed a parameterization of the high frequency stress
\item And $\tau_{wave}$ is obtained as an integral over the wind input formula of the wave model.

%\frame{
%  \frametitle{{\tt MPI} based models}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Geophysical models are dominated by the {\tt MPI} parallel formalism. In it the program is split into several nodes that communicate by {\tt Recv}/{\tt Send} commands.
%\item As a consequence, when parallelizing models, it is best to have at the beginning an assignment in {\tt MyColor} of the nature of the node, then call
%\begin{center}
%{\tt MPI\_COMM\_SPLIT(MPI\_COMM\_WORLD, MyColor, MyCOMM)}
%\end{center}
%From that point we have a new communicator {\tt MyCOMM} that can be used inside of the existing code by replacing the {\tt MPI\_COMM\_WORLD}
%\item So, apart from exchanging data, merging two {\tt MPI} programs together takes only a few lines.
%\end{itemize}
%}


\frame{
  \frametitle{Model coupling library, {\tt PGMCL} }
\begin{itemize}
\item The exchange between coupled models (via {\tt COMM\_SPLIT}) requires the sending of data between them.
\item A priori the grids are different, the model nature may be different (Structure/Unstructured grids) and so interpolation is needed between the models.
\item There are several existing libraries {\tt MCT}, {\tt OASIS}, {\tt PALM}, etc but when considering them, they appear all relatively complicated.
\item We considered {\tt MCT} and it appeared to be impossible to achieve the goals that we wanted (optimal exchanges, interpolation, performance, etc.).
\item Henceforth, we designed our own library {\tt PGMCL} (Parallel Geophysical Model Coupling Library) for coupling models.
\item After declarations, the commands become as simple as
\begin{center}
{\tt CALL MPI\_INTERP\_SEND(TheArr\_WAVtoOCN, Hwave)}\\
{\tt CALL MPI\_INTERP\_RECV(TheArr\_WAVtoOCN, Hwave)}

%  \frametitle{Coupling of {\tt WAM} and {\tt COSMO}}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The {\tt WAM} model, originally the first $3^{rd}$ generation wave model, is a wave model used by many institutions  in the world.
%\item The {\tt COSMO} model is based on the Lokall modell of DWD.
%\item Both are finite difference models that are coupled via {\tt PGMCL}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The atmospheric model provides the wind and air density to wave model.
%\item The wave model provides the Charnock coefficient to the atmospheric model.
%\end{itemize}
%\item Results on the Mediterranean indicate a slight decrease of wind magnitude.

\frame{
  \frametitle{Numerics of the coupling I}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mathematical expressions occurring in wave coupling theories are dangerous expressions like:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\cosh(2k (z+h))}{\sinh(2k (h+\xi))}
\end{equation*}
\item This kind of function is very singular. Their large values are concentrated on the surface. On the other hand it satisfies a specific integral property:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{h+\xi} \int_{-h}^{\xi} \frac{\cosh(2k (z+h))}{\sinh(2k (h+\xi))} dz=\frac{1}{2k(h+\xi)}
\end{equation*}
which has to be reproduced in the model.
\item The solution that we choose is for every vertical cell of the model, to compute explicitly the integral and put the average value at the relevant point.
\item We also use a $k_{eff} = \frac{1}{D} \min(300, k(h+\xi))$.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{
  \frametitle{Numerics of the coupling II}
\begin{itemize}
\item For the Stokes drift the model value for a vertical cell between depth $z$ and $z'$ is
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{rcl}
(u_s^{model}, v_s^{model})
&=& \frac{1}{z' - z}\int_k \int_z^{z'} (u_s, v_s) dz dk = (*)\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
\item After computation this gives:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{rcl}
(*) &=& \int_k \sigma {\bf k} E(k)dk  \frac{1}{\sinh^2(k(h+\xi))} \frac{\sinh(2k(z'+h)) - \sinh(2k(z+h))}{2k(z'-z)}\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
\item After simplification this gives:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{rcl}
(*) &=& \int_k \sigma {\bf k} E(k) dk \frac{\cosh(kz+kz' + 2kh)}{\sinh^2(k(h+\xi))}  \textcolor{red}{\frac{\sinh(k(z' - z))}{k(z'-z)}}
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
which is numerically stable.
\item If one does not add the final part then the baroclinic Stokes drift does not match the analytical value.
\end{itemize}

\item We can reduce it to $N_{node}\times N_{freq} \times (N_{dir} + N_{vert})$.
\item Truncation formulation is comparable in complexity.

\frame{
  \frametitle{Grid subdivizion schemes}

\item Our standard interpolation strategy is to subdivide the squares in two triangles. Then near the coast, we add some more triangles.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Wind direction is more unstable when the waves are smaller.
%\item For surface current, we see that the Stokes drift is fairly important for the Western Adriatic Current.

  \frametitle{Impact of various parameterizations}

\begin{itemize}
\item The most significant impact of coupling with wave model on surface currents is the parameterization $z_{0,sea} = 0.5 H_s$ of sea roughness length.
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduction of $15$ cm/s of current speed during bora events on the tip of Istria
\end{itemize}
\item The next most significant effect is the effect of GLM formulation with reduction of current speed by $3$ cm/s on the Italian coastline
\item Finally the use of surface stress from the wave model is difficult to assess but leads to further decrease of surface currents in the bora jet.
\end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Possible extensions}

\begin{itemize}
\item We did the coupling of COSMO and WAM. Key point is the Charnock coefficient is computed in the WAM model and used by the atmospheric model.
\begin{itemize}
\item The atmospheric model provides the wind and air density to wave model.
\item The wave model provides the Charnock coefficient to the atmospheric model.
\end{itemize}
\item Results on the Mediterranean indicate a slight decrease of wind magnitude and an overall improvements in wave and wind statistics when comparing with altimeter and stations.
\item Further coupling with Atmospheric local model, for example COSMO or WRF.
\item Key issue is the physical parameterization of the sea surface.
\end{itemize}
